# EVE Swagger Interface (ESI) SDK

ESI SDK is a Ruby API client for the EVE Swagger Interface (ESI), the official API for the [EVE Online](https://eveonline.com) MMORPG.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'esi-sdk'
```

And then execute:

```shell
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself with:

```shell
gem install esi-sdk
```

## Usage

Create an instance of `ESI::Client` with your own `User-Agent`:

```ruby
require 'esi-sdk'

client = ESI::Client.new(user_agent: 'My ESI Bot/1.0; +(https://example.com)')
```

Call an ESI endpoint:

```ruby
response = client.get_character(character_id: 2113024536)

{
  "alliance_id" => 99003214,
  "ancestry_id" => 37,
  "birthday" => "2017-07-20T16:28:17Z",
  "bloodline_id" => 13,
  "corporation_id" => 98169165,
  "description" => "",
  "gender" => "male",
  "name" => "Bokobo Shahni",
  "race_id" => 4,
  "security_status" => 0.7826388230000001
}
```

See the documentation for [ESI::Client](https://bokoboshahni.github.io/esi-sdk-ruby/ESI/Client.html) for detailed information on each endpoint.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
